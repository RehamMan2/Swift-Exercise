/*
Exercise (2)
 
 Consider a car.  What attributes and properties of a car could we capture using variables and constants? Which attributes would be mutable and which would be immutable?
 
 Create variables and constants for the following attributes of a car, and then print each one.
 
 1.  paintColor
 2.  make
 3.  model
 4.  year
 5.  isManualTransmission
 6. seats
 7. mileage
 */

var paintColor = "Red"
var make = "Toyota"
var model = "Camry"
var year = 2018
var isManualTransmission = true
var seats = 9
var mileage = 79000.0

let initialMileage = mileage

print("Paint Color: \(paintColor)")
print("Make: \(make)")
print("Model: \(model)")
print("Year: \(year)")
print("Manual Transmission: \(isManualTransmission)")
print("Seats: \(seats)")
print("Mileage: \(mileage)")
print("Initial Mileage: \(initialMileage)")
